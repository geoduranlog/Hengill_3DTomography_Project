# Hengill_Project

This set of codes support part of the results of the local earthquake tomography performed during my PhD.

- 3D Local Eatrhquake Tomography of the Hengill region in SW Iceland.
- Computation of Min 1D seismic velocity model from a simultaneous hypocenter velocity inversion.
- Analysis of seismicity in the region and b-values computation.
