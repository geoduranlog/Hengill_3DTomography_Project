T. Diehl - 2020/03/09 - SIMULPS Repository

content of repository:


src: includes the source file of SIMULPS14 and the corresponding makefile. To compile do "make".
Static array-dimensions and other parameters for SIMULPS are defined in: simulps14_common.inc
Static array-dimensions and other parameters for RKP-Raytracer are defined in: rayparax_common.inc
I use it on Linux Ubuntu, but I think it should also work on OSX. Depending on the
size of you problem you should rum it on a machine like bigstar (not on your laptop)
since it can take several ours#

Doc: Includes the manuals (the general one + additional comments related to version 14
(extended raytracer) - PLEASE READ BOTH DOCUMENTATIONS CAREFULLY IN THE NEXT DAYS

Testcase_CH: This directory contains all input files of my current Swiss Model. However, I limited
the phase file in size. But you can use them as "template examples" for your own input files.

Tools: I have added tools to help you with preparation and analysis:

	python: Contains python codes to convert phase and station files
	- phase_filter4tomo_Refined.py: This tools is very useful to analyse the VELEST output (filter for residuals etc etc etc check: phase_filter4tomo_Refined.py -h).
	In addition you can convert the VELEST CNV output (your minimum 1D locations) to SIMULPS format by:
	phase_filter4tomo_Refined.py -F SH_E_002_SEL10upd6_Pg_RCC_invratio1.cnv -o SH_E_002_SEL10upd6_Pg_RCC_invratio1.cnv.EQKS -e simulps -E
	
	- convert_station.py: This tool converts station-files into various formats, e.g. VELEST to SIMULPS
	convert_station.py -s SH_E_002_SEL10upd6_Pg_RCC_invratio1.sta -i VELEST -o SH_E_002_SEL10upd6_Pg_RCC_invratio1.sta.STNS -e SIMULPS

	fortran: Contains fortran codes to prepare input and analyse output of SIMULPS

        - make3DsimulMOD: Code to generate initial 3D model file for SIMULPS
	edit parameters in make3DsimulMOD.cmn - You have the re-parameterize your layered minimum 1D model to a gradient model, I will send
	you examples in the next days.
	compile code with: gfortran -o make3DsimulMOD make3DsimulMOD.f

	- tomo2gmt: This is the key code to convert the simulps output to format used for plotting e.g. with GMT. It produces e.g. files with
	horizontal and/or vertical cross-sections. Compile with "make"
