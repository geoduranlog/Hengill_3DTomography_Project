				NOTES - ADN 03.04.2020

This code takes SimulPS output and converted in gmt format (you make an interpolation of the vmodel for that). Such code is in  /Users/alejandro/ICELAND_Project/Tomography/SIMULPS14/Tools/fortran/tomo2gmt
However, what I did was to compile it and copy the executable to bash so you can use it from any directory. 

Instructions about Compilation here
/Users/alejandro/ICELAND_Project/Tomography/SIMULPS14/SimulPS_Instruction_Tobias.docx


----Instruction about use:------
Go to your Simulps14 directory (where I got the inversion results ->vmodel, example:  ~/Tomography/SIMULPS14/TEST_simulps/Coseismiq_3x3x1p5_d100/) and run it by typing

  tomo2gmt
